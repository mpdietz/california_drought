# Drought Monitor Indicator
Drought Monitor zones are based percipitation, soil moisture and ground water level based on historic conditions. 

                0 = Abnormally Dry </br>
                1 = Moderate Drought </br>
                2 = Severe Drought </br>
                3 = Extreme Drought </br>
                4 = Exceptional Drought </br></br>

                Drought Monitor zones are generated weekly. This map uses the data from the end of the first week of each year for consistency over time. For more information see (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home/Narrative.aspx) U.S. Drought Monitor. 
                
#Population
    In order to show the relative population distribution of people. A dot density projection was generated from city population counts. Each point represents 1000 people. This can disort the real population but provides a spatial understanding relative to drought zones.
